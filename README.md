"# Stanford-Cars-Image-Classification" 

Deep Neural Networks can be used for classification, regression and generative modeling.

This notebook shows the power of transferred learning:
1. To improve the predictive power of Image Classification for the Stanford Cars Dataset significantly
2. and their applicability in Deep Learning. Where I didn't have enough RAM Space to build complex architecture models from scratch, pretrained models such as resnet34 allowed me to proceed

I built Convolutional Neural Networks and used various advanced techniques like Normalization, Data Augmentation, Regularization, Residual connections, etc. to perform Image Classification for the Stanford Cars Dataset.
